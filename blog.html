        <h3>Birds</h3>
        <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves.
            Characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws,
            the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
            Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich.
            There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds.
            Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.
            Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds,
            including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.
            The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
            Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. </p>

        <h3>The Antelope</h3>
        <p>Not surprisingly for animals with long, slender yet powerful legs, many antelope have long strides and can run fast.
            Some (e.g. klipspringer) are also adapted to inhabiting rock koppies and crags.
            Both dibatags and gerenuks habitually stand on their two hind legs to reach acacia and other tree foliage.
            Different antelope have different body types, which can affect movement. Duikers are short,
            bush-dwelling antelope that can pick through dense foliage and dive into the shadows rapidly.
            Gazelle and springbok are known for their speed and leaping abilities.
            Even larger antelope, such as nilgai, elands, and kudus, are capable of jumping 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) or greater,
            although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass. </p>

        <h3>Waterfall</h3>
        <p>
            A waterfall is a point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops.
            Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.
            Waterfalls can be formed in several ways,
            but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top
            layer of resistant bedrock before falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster,
            leading to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.
            Humans have had a distinct relationship with waterfalls for years, travelling to see them, exploring and naming them.
            They can present formidable barriers to navigation along rivers.
            Waterfalls are religious sites in many cultures.
