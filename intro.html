    This pickup was used as a picture when creating the movers transport system.
    The pick up symbolises the vehicles used for the transportation of input such as fertilisers and farm products
    Creating the system was a hectic project but a worth while one since it paid a lot in the end
    Hope the system is going to be of help to many transporting companies
    It took seven months to create the whole system
